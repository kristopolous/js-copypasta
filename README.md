# Sometimes you just want one isolated function.

Sometimes I find myself writing the same helper functions in situations where I don't want to pull in a library, just put in some really small function.

This is a *different* kind of toolkit ... there's no source to include.

Instead, there's a description of each function, what it does, and then a multi and one line version of it for you to put into your code.
